## 📖 Overview

Photoplethysmography (PPG) is a non-invasive optical technique widely used for monitoring biosignals and cardiovascular health, prevalent in both clinical settings and consumer wearable devices. Current machine learning models for PPG signals are often task-specific and struggle with generalizability. Many prior works utilize single-device datasets, neglect out-of-domain generalization, or do not publicly release their models, thereby limiting reproducibility and broader research progress.

**PaPaGei** is the **first open foundation model for PPG signals**. It is pre-trained on over **57,000 hours** of 20 million unlabeled PPG segments, exclusively using publicly available datasets. We benchmark PaPaGei against popular time-series foundation models and other methods across **20 tasks from 10 diverse datasets**, covering cardiovascular health, sleep disorders, pregnancy monitoring, and wellbeing assessment.

Our novel architecture incorporates representation learning approaches that capitalize on morphological differences in PPG signals across individuals, enabling it to **capture richer representations** than traditional contrastive learning methods. PaPaGei demonstrates significant improvements, boosting classification and regression performance by an average of **6.3% and 2.9%**, respectively, compared to other leading time-series foundation models in at least 14 tasks. Notably, PaPaGei is **more data- and parameter-efficient**, outperforming models up to 70x larger.

Beyond accuracy, we investigate robustness against different skin tones, establishing a benchmark for evaluating bias in future models. PaPaGei can be readily used as a **feature extractor** or an **encoder** for multimodal models, paving the way for new advancements in multimodal health monitoring.

## 🛠️ How to Use PaPaGei

PaPaGei offers versatility for developers and researchers:

1.  **Out-of-the-Box Feature Extraction**: Use PaPaGei to extract transferable features for your machine learning tasks, replacing handcrafted features.
2.  **PPG Encoder Integration**: Incorporate PaPaGei as a PPG encoder into larger frontier models (e.g., LLMs like [AnyMAL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16058)).

### 📦 Installation

1.  **Create a Conda Environment:**
    ```bash
    conda create -n papagei_env python=3.10
    conda activate papagei_env
    ```
2.  **Install Required Packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3.  **Install pyPPG Package:**
    ```bash
    pip install pyPPG==1.0.41
    ```
    *Note: This might show a `wfdb` package conflict, but it should still function correctly.*

### 🧠 Downloading Model Weights

Model weights are hosted on Zenodo by Arvind Pillai.
* **Download Link**: [Zenodo Record 13983110](https://zenodo.org/records/13983110)
* For feature extraction, save the downloaded model weights (e.g., `papagei_s.pt`) into a folder named `weights/` in your project directory, or update the path accordingly in your scripts.

### ✨ Extracting Embeddings: Quick Start

Here’s a brief example of how to load the PaPaGei-S model and extract embeddings:

1.  **Import Necessary Packages:**
    ```python
    import numpy as np
    import torch
    from linearprobing.utils import resample_batch_signal, load_model_without_module_prefix
    from preprocessing.ppg import preprocess_one_ppg_signal
    from segmentations import waveform_to_segments
    from torch_ecg._preprocessors import Normalize
    from models.resnet import ResNet1DMoE
    ```

2.  **Load the PaPaGei-S Model:**
    ```python
    # Define Model Configuration
    model_config = {
        'base_filters': 32,
        'kernel_size': 3,
        'stride': 2,
        'groups': 1,
        'n_block': 18,
        'n_classes': 512, # Embedding dimension
        'n_experts': 3
    }

    # Initialize Model
    model = ResNet1DMoE(
        in_channels=1,
        base_filters=model_config['base_filters'],
        kernel_size=model_config['kernel_size'],
        stride=model_config['stride'],
        groups=model_config['groups'],
        n_block=model_config['n_block'],
        n_classes=model_config['n_classes'],
        n_experts=model_config['n_experts']
    )

    # Load Pre-trained Weights
    model_path = "weights/papagei_s.pt" # Ensure this path is correct
    model = load_model_without_module_prefix(model, model_path)
    device = "cuda" if torch.cuda.is_available() else "cpu"
    model.to(device)
    model.eval() # Set model to evaluation mode
    print(f"Model loaded on {device}")
    ```

3.  **Pre-process a PPG Signal:**
    ```python
    # Example PPG Signal
    fs = 500  # Original sampling frequency in Hz
    fs_target = 125 # Target sampling frequency in Hz
    segment_duration_seconds = 10 # Duration of each segment in seconds
    signal_duration_seconds = 60 # Total duration of the example signal

    signal = np.random.randn(signal_duration_seconds * fs) # Example: 60s signal at 500Hz
    print(f"Original PPG dimensions: {signal.shape}")

    # Clean and segment the signal
    signal_processed, _, _, _ = preprocess_one_ppg_signal(waveform=signal, frequency=fs)
    
    segment_length_original_fs = fs * segment_duration_seconds
    segmented_signals = waveform_to_segments(
        waveform_name='ppg', # Can be any name, not strictly used in this function
        segment_length=segment_length_original_fs,
        clean_signal=signal_processed
    )
    
    # Resample segments
    resampled_segments = resample_batch_signal(
        segmented_signals, 
        fs_original=fs, 
        fs_target=fs_target, 
        axis=-1
    )
    print(f"After segmentation and resampling: {resampled_segments.shape}") # (num_segments, segment_length_target_fs)

    # Convert to PyTorch Tensor
    signal_tensor = torch.Tensor(resampled_segments).unsqueeze(dim=1).to(device) # (num_segments, 1, segment_length_target_fs)
    ```

4.  **Extract Embeddings:**
    ```python
    with torch.inference_mode():
        outputs = model(signal_tensor)
        # PaPaGei-S returns a tuple (embeddings, expert_outputs, gating_weights)
        # We are interested in the first element: embeddings
        embeddings = outputs[0].cpu().detach().numpy()
    print(f"Embedding dimensions: {embeddings.shape}") # (num_segments, n_classes)
    ```

👉 For a comprehensive end-to-end example, including feature extraction and downstream task evaluation on the `ppg-bp` dataset, please refer to the Jupyter Notebook: [`example_papagei.ipynb`](https://github.com/Nokia-Bell-Labs/papagei-foundation-model/blob/main/example_papagei.ipynb).

**Important Considerations:**
* **Model Variability**: No single model excels across all tasks and datasets. We release the models that achieved the most wins in our evaluations.
* **Confidence Intervals**: Instead of fixed random seeds, we use bootstrapping (500 iterations) to compute 95% confidence intervals, providing a performance range.
